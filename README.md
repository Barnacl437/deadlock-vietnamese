# deadlock-vietnamese
An attempt to see and play Deadlock in *Vietnamese texts*. A (sort of) localisation project.

## ...Deadlock? 
[Deadlock](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1422450) is a currently in-early-development game by [Valve Software](https://valvesoftware.com). There are already several community translation projects, and this will *possibly* become one.

## why? 
started as personal fun during playtest, I decided to bring it on up here for people to help people installing the language files and play the game in Vietnamese language. Still in progress, and need more improvement. I also hope if one day Valve developers deems this localisation project complete and accept it to be included in a next game update.

This repo may work as either a stable or temporary basis to wait and see if there are any other similar project for Vietnamese localisation efforts. I am happy to help any of them if possible.

## what's in? 
currently there are 5 folders with Vietnamese lang file which were not translated before (contain nothing more than just a few code lines indicating the language name) and then filled up with English translations as placeholder, located in `\steamapps\common\Deadlock\game\citadel\resource\localization`: (`citadel_` prefix) `main, mods, heroes, attributes, gc`. 

## status
There are some progress with the `main` file which contain GUI text for main menu and basic UI texts. In early stage which is about 30-35% complete.

## can i fix something mate?
You are absolutely welcome to jump in! For the best localisation efforts, it is recommended that you have played the game before (so that you can check for faults and also to know about the game itself), getting well with gaming terms and item naming, descriptions, etc., a bit salty wording is okay but don't break the overall intention of developers. And ultimately, it is the best to be a native Vietnamese knowing all these stuff, though not required, just anyone with a competent knowledge of the language is fine. That's why I am needing help right now. I feel that only myself might not do them all well. Thanks mates.

## seems interesting! how can i try the translation in advance of perfection?
Just download the repo source code, unzip the `localization` folder and copy/move it into this directory: `[...]\steamapps\common\Deadlock\game\citadel\resource`, where `[...]` is where your Steam Library is located, i.e. where your Steam games are to be installed into.

You can also press the gear icon in Steam Library interface of your game, or right click on game name and select Manage > Browse local files to get into game folder quickly.

And follow the above directory to find into the `resource` folder. Then press the gear icon/right click like above again, but choose properties, then add some lines to the launch options `-language vietnamese`. Enjoy and have fun!
