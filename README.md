# deadlock-vietnamese
An attempt to see and play Deadlock in *Vietnamese texts*. A (sort of) localisation project.

## ...Deadlock? 
[Deadlock](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1422450) is a currently in-early-development game by [Valve Software](https://valvesoftware.com). There are already several community translation projects, and this will *possibly* become one.

## why? 
started as personal fun during playtest, I decided to bring it on up here for people to help people installing the language files and play the game in Vietnamese language. Still in progress, and need more improvement. I also hope if one day Valve developers deems this localisation project complete and accept it to be included in a next game update.

This repo may work as either a stable or temporary basis to wait and see if there are any other similar project for Vietnamese localisation efforts. I am happy to help any of them if possible.

## what's in? 
currently there are 5 folders with Vietnamese lang file which were not translated before (contain nothing more than just a few code lines indicating the language name) and then filled up with English translations as placeholder, located in `\steamapps\common\Deadlock\game\citadel\resource\localization`: (`citadel_` prefix) `main, mods, heroes, attributes, gc`. 

## status
There are some progress with the `main` file which contain GUI text for main menu and basic UI texts. 

## can i fix something mate?
You are absolutely welcome to jump in! For the best localisation efforts, it is recommended that you have played the game before, getting well with gaming terms and item naming, descriptions, etc., a bit salty wording is okay but don't break the overall intention of developers. And ultimately, it is the best to be a native Vietnamese knowing all these stuff, though not required, just anyone with a competent knowledge of the language is fine. That's why I am needing help right now. I feel that only myself might not do them all well. Thanks mates.
